    LARRY
    Well Steve, that was a good game of chess.

    STEVE
    Only because you won.
    Wouldn't think so if I won.

    LARRY
    Are you jealous Steve?

    STEVE
    Uh...
    No...infact I think your the one who's jealous.

    LARRY
    But I'm the guy who won.

    STEVE
    You're jealous because you didn't lose like me.

    LARRY
    Alright...
    That's enough from you.

    STEVE
    Yeah, I guess so.
    Well, I gotta get going.

    He needs help.
    
    JANITOR

    BARNEY
    Why hello there.
    
    LARRY
    Thanks man...
    I owe you
    
    BARNEY
    Actually, you do...
    twenty bucks from losing that game of pool...
    ...last night.
    
    LARRY
    Oh yeah...
    I was gonna get that to you...
    ...but...
    
    BARNEY
    Just forget about it.
    If we get out of here alive...
    then you owe me twenty.
    
    LARRY
    What?
    Are there more?
    
    BARNEY
    Oh yeah.
    The building's full of them.
    
    LARRY
    Why?
    
    BARNEY
    I'll explain later.
    We gotta get to the weapons locker.
    Come on.

END

SCENE-5C
    
    BARNEY
    Here we are...
    the weapons locker...
    Oh, and here, take this.
    That's a blue access card.
    Come on Larry...
    We gotta get you a weapon.

END

SCENE-7A
    
    LARRY
    Wow!
    I feel like I'm in The Matrix.
    
    BARNEY
    OK, Larry, listen up...
    This floor is where all the weapons are stored.
    Grab whatever weapons you feel like.
    Make sure you pack ammo too.
    Be careful though...
    You can only pack so much ammo...
    So don't go trigger happy and lose all of it.
    
    LARRY
    OK, I gotcha.
    
    BARNEY
    OK...
    Now here's the problem...
    All the phones are dead.
    Something's disconnected the main phone line.
    So we can't call for help.
    
    LARRY
    Darn!
    
    BARNEY
    We can't access the lobby to get out of here...
    Because the access level for that floor has...
    been set to code-red.
    And the maximum access I have is code-blue.
    
    LARRY
    Darn!
    
    BARNEY
    I just gave you an extra code-blue card.
    That'll give you access to doors and rooms...
    that require blue acess and anything lower...
    which the only thing lower is green...
    and everybody has access to green.
    
    LARRY
    Cool!
    
    BARNEY
    Meanwhile, this weapons locker dosen't have much.
    The room behind me has alot more...
    but...
    it requires code-yellow access...
    
    LARRY
    Darn!
    
    BARNEY
    We need to split up and see if we can find...
    a code-yellow access card.
    
    LARRY
    Alright!
    
    BARNEY
    Oh, and here's something else.
    
    LARRY
    A walky-talky...
    Cool!
    
    BARNEY
    That's for us to keep in touch.
    
    LARRY
    Well, duh.
    
    BARNEY
    OK, Larry...
    Let's move out.

    Your alive!
    
    STEVE
    Yep.
    What do you remember?
    
    LARRY
    Uh...
    I was in a dark room...
    
    STEVE
    And?
    
    LARRY
    I was going to do something...
    Then something hit my head...
    and I woke up here.
    
    STEVE
    Strange...
    I woke up here too after I drank the cola.
    
    LARRY
    Do you know about the aliens?
    
    STEVE
    What?!
    
    LARRY
    The buildings been invaded by them.
    
    STEVE
    Not more aliens!
    
    LARRY
    I'm afraid so.
    
    STEVE
    ...
    
    LARRY
    ...
    
    STEVE
    But where are we?
    
    LARRY
    I don't know.
    I don't recognize this part of the building...
    if we are in the building.
    Hmm...
    I still have my walky-talky.

    Hehehe...
    
    LARRY
    Huh?
    
    BARNEY
    This building's mine now.
    
    LARRY
    !!!
    What?!
    
    BARNEY
    It's too bad for you, Larry.
    I was thinking of letting you in on the deal...
    but I knew you would be too stubborn.
    
    LARRY
    What deal?
    
    BARNEY
    The aliens have technology far superior to us...
    It's only a matter of time before the earth...
    is taken over and ruled by then.
    So they contacted us for helping them make...
    that happen faster.
    
    LARRY
    Barney! You traitor!
    
    BARNEY
    Hehehe...
    I told you I would tell you what was going on.
    
    LARRY
    What did you do to help the aliens, Barney!
    
    BARNEY
    Me and some friends built a portal for them...
    A portal that directly leads from our world...
    to theirs, and their world to ours.
    
    LARRY
    You're mad!
    
    BARNEY
    Mad!
    I'll tell you what's mad...
    Mad is believing that we can stop these...
    high-tech aliens from invading our planet.
    
    LARRY
    Our planet?!
    You've betrayed this planet.
    
    BARNEY
    I saved it is what.
    Now, since I've got you trapped in there...
    There's no one that can stop me now.
    Hehehe...

    What do we do?
    
    LARRY
    First, we should find a way out of here.
    
    STEVE
    We can't.
    
    LARRY
    What?
    
    STEVE
    I've searched everywhere...
    There's no way out...

    Uh...
    I thought I did...
    
    LARRY
    Whatever...
    Room 7 is the weapon's locker.
    Here's a copy of a code-yellow access card.
    
    STEVE
    ...
    And?
    
    LARRY
    Sorry...you've been stuck in a room all this
    time. You aren't aware.
    
    STEVE
    Ah jeez! I don't need more bad news.
    I thought you already gave me the bad news!
    Aliens are inside the building. Check.
    ...
    What else is there worth noting?
    
    LARRY
    We're trapped inside with them.
    
    STEVE
    !!!

    LARRY
    The lobby doors are set to code-red.
    We're not leaving until we find a red card.
    
    STEVE
    Oh...
    Okay...
    
    LARRY
    This yellow card will help you get around the...
    building, through green, blue, and yellow doors.
    
    STEVE
    Cool!
    ...
    Here's something I found...
    Look's like it's half of a card.
    
    LARRY
    Thanks...
    We've got to find the code-red access card...
    before barney does.
    He needs it for something...
    And I'm guessing he wants it for the room above.

    Thanks, Steve...
    but it's kinda late for that.
    
    BARNEY
    I see you managed to escape and find a red card.
    
    LARRY
    Glad to see that you found one too.

    Yep...
    Steve also found one.
    
    STEVE
    Plus 1 for me!
    
    LARRY
    Talk about the timing.
    
    BARNEY
    It's a shame I was here first.
    Now I can finally reopen this portal.
    
    LARRY
    Reopen?
    
    BARNEY
    Hahaha!!!
    Larry, you still make me laugh.
    How do you think the aliens got here in the
    first place?
    
    LARRY
    *Shrugs*
    
    BARNEY
    Anyway...
    It's good to get one last laugh in.
    One last laugh before you meet your fate.

    Sorry, pal...
    It'll be your last laugh.
    Like...ever...

    Yeah! You tell him, Larry!
    
    LARRY
    *Face palm*

    That's a bold statement coming from you.

    I'm always alive.

    At least this time it's for a good thing...
    like the code-yellow access card.
    Let me have it so I can make a copy.

    How do I know if you'll use this card for good?"

    What?!
    Are you crazy?
    It was hard enough to find a yellow one.
    And you copied it before we went in so you...
    could rush in and have the first pick.
    I knew you'd use the card for evil!

    Oh, will you stop whining and get with it?
