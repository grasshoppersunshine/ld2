    Well Steve, that was a good game of chess.

    STEVE
    Only because you won.
    Wouldn't think so if I won.

    LARRY
    Are you jealous Steve?

    STEVE
    Uh...
    No...in fact I think you're the one who's jealous.

    LARRY
    But I'm the guy who won.

    STEVE
    You're jealous because you didn't lose like me.

    LARRY
    Alright...
    That's enough from you.

    STEVE
    Yeah, I guess so.
    Well, I gotta get going.

    You a doctor?
    
    JANITOR
    Why yes...
    I use this mop to suck diseases out of people.
    
    LARRY
    This is no time to be sarcastic!
    My friend is sick, passed out on the floor...
    ... after drinking a cola from the vending machine.
    He needs help!
    
    JANITOR
    The vending machine? That hasn't been checked in ages!
    In fact, those colas are...
    ...
    
    LARRY
    ...
    
    JANITOR
    ... are brand new! I just changed them out today.
    Yes, sir!
    
    LARRY
    Mother of god!
    
    JANITOR
    ...
    Well... I was only being sarcastic about the mop.
    I am a doctor.
    
    LARRY
    Seriously?
    #What, now you'll tell me you completed your degree today as well?

    BARNEY
    Actually, you do.
    Twenty bucks from losing that game of pool last night.
    
    LARRY
    Oh yeah...
    I was gonna get that to you...
    ... but...
    
    BARNEY
    Forget about it.
    We have bigger problems to worry about...
    ... like getting out of here alive.
    
    LARRY
    What?!
    Are there more?
    
    BARNEY
    Oh yeah.
    The building's swarmed with aliens.

    OK, Larry, now listen up!
    This floor is where all the weapons are stored.
    You've fought these creatures before...
    ... so I think you know what you need.
    
    LARRY
    I do.
    I'll need everything I can take.
    
    BARNEY
    Good!
    Now here's the problem...
    All forms of communication with the outside world have been sabotaged.
    The land line is disconnected. Phones are dead.
    And the satelitte systems are jammed.
    So we can't call for help.
    
    LARRY
    Damn!
    
    BARNEY
    I can't get outside, because the doors to the lobby are locked.
    The security system's been hacked, and my access card is now denied to that floor.
    
    LARRY
    So we're trapped inside this building?
    
    BARNEY
    Unfortunately.
    
    LARRY
    Damn!
    
    BARNEY
    Meanwhile, we won't survive for very long with what's in this room.
    We have limited firepower.
    We are low on ammunition. This room doesn't have much of that.
    The room behind me has much more.
    But... it requires a yellow access card to get inside.
    
    LARRY
    Damn!
    
    BARNEY
    We need to split up and find a yellow access card.
    
    LARRY
    Alright!
    
    BARNEY
    Oh, and here's something else.
    
    LARRY
    A walky-talky?
    
    BARNEY
    Yes, so we can keep in touch.

    Nice!

    LARRY_RADIO
    What deal?
    
    BARNEY_RADIO
    The aliens have technology far superior to us...
    It's only a matter of time before the earth...
    is taken over and ruled by then.
    So they contacted us for helping them make...
    that happen faster.

    What did you do to help the aliens, Barney!
    
    BARNEY_RADIO
    Me and some friends built a portal for them...
    A portal that directly leads from our world...
    to theirs, and their world to ours.
    
    LARRY_RADIO
    You're mad!
    
    BARNEY_RADIO
    Mad!
    I'll tell you what's mad...
    Mad is believing that we can stop these...
    high-tech aliens from invading our planet.
    
    LARRY_RADIO
    Our planet?!
    You've betrayed this planet.

SCENE-DONUT-A
    
    MARKUS
    Take the doughnut, a simple, yet elegant design.
    An adequately-sized package that delivers calories and nutrients.
    Every part edible.
    Nothing remaining after you eat it. Nothing to throw away.
    
    LARRY
    Except maybe sticky fingers.
    
    MARKUS
    Right you are! I address that problem, however.
    I'll come back around to the sticky-fingers issue shortly.
    Now, back to the process...
    
    MARKUS
    I developed specialized eyewear...
    ...it allows me to see the world at a molecular resolution.
    It accentuates even the slightest impurities in anything I'm looking at.
    It is such fine detail, beyond the resolution of the eye.
    In fact, it can't use the eye. Our eyes are too low of a resolution.
    Instead, it bypasses the retina and optic nerve...
    ...and interfaces directly with the occipital lobe, the part of the brain that processes vision.
    
    LARRY
    And you use this for...?
    ...baking?
    
    MARKUS
    Precisely!
    
    MARKUS
    After frying, we use a proprietary method of refridgeration to cool the doughnut...
    ...to maintain its structural integrity.
    
    MARKUS
    I had a mechanic-friend help me design and develop a machine...
    ...that injects the precise amount of jelly into the now-cooled doughnut.
    It uses light beams and harmonic resonance to guide the jelly...
    ...across a short space and safely into the doughnut.
    
    MARKUS
    Then, finally, the doughnut is covered in a specialized resin.
    This resin diminishes the stickiness...
    ...but keeps the texture and taste of the glaze intact.
    ...so...
    No more sticky fingers!
