    LARRY
    Well, Steve, that was one good game of chess.

    STEVE
    Only because you won.
    Wouldn't think so if I won.

    LARRY
    Are you jealous, Steve?

    STEVE
    Uh... No...
    In fact... I think you are the jealous one.

    LARRY
    Ok, but... I didn't lose.
    ... so...

    STEVE
    That's just your perspective...
    ... it's all relative.

    LARRY
    ...
    You admitted that I won.
    
    STEVE
    We both won.
    But you both lost and won.
    Trust me... it's a quantum physics thing.
    
    LARRY
    ...
    Yeah... that's not how quantum physics works.
    
    STEVE

    Well... I should get going.

    Happy to catch-up on current events and play a game of anxiety-inducing chess.

    No, but... if you kick it, you get one for free.

    Ha! Kick it in the "D"!

    I use this mop to suck diseases out of people.

    This is no time to be sarcastic!
    My friend is sick, passed out on the floor...
    ... after drinking a cola from the vending machine.
    He needs help!

    Oh, yeah...
    I was gonna get that to you...

    We have bigger problems to worry about...

    BARNEY
    OK, Larry, now listen up!
    This floor is where all the weapons are stored.
    You've fought these creatures before...
    ... so I think you know what you need.
    
    LARRY
    I do.
    I'll need everything I can take.
    
    BARNEY
    Good!
    Now here's the situation...
    All forms of communication with the outside world have been sabotaged.
    The land line is disconnected. Phones are dead.
    And the satelitte systems are jammed.
    So we can't call for help.
    
    LARRY
    Damn!
    
    BARNEY
    I can't get outside, because the doors to the lobby are locked.
    The security system's been hacked, and my access card is now denied to that floor.
    
    LARRY
    So we're trapped inside this building?
    
    BARNEY
    Unfortunately.
    
    LARRY
    ...
    Damn!
    
    BARNEY
    Meanwhile, we won't survive for very long with what's in this room.
    We have limited firepower.
    We are low on ammunition. This room doesn't have much of that.
    The room behind me has much more.
    But... it requires a yellow access card to get inside.
    
    LARRY
    ...
    
    BARNEY
    ...
    We need to split up and find a yellow access card.
    
    LARRY
    Got it!
    
    BARNEY
    Oh, and here's something else.
    
    LARRY
    A walkie-talkie?
    
    BARNEY
    Ahem, it's called a handheld transceiver.
    
    LARRY
    Yes, so we can keep in touch?
    
    BARNEY
    Correct.

    ...
    I don't know how I ended up here.
    I remember drinking the cola...
    ... then I felt very weak.
    After falling to the floor, I passed out completely.
    The next thing I knew... I was here, coming out of a daze.
    Was very nauseous too... I threw up all over the place.
    Felt much better after that.
    
    LARRY
    ...
    
    STEVE
    I was looking for a way out when I heard a noise...
    ... sort of like a metal door creaking shut.
    I sneaked over to see what it was.
    That's when I found you lying, face down, on the floor.
    
    STEVE
    ...
    What do you remember?
    
    LARRY
    Uh...
    I was exploring a floor that's been vacant and empty for ages.
    
    STEVE
    Ooh! Was it the 13th floor?

    No...

    STEVE
    Oh...
    ... Be cool if it was.
    
    LARRY
    Right... Anyway...
    I was in a dark area, pitch black. I brought a flashlight with me.
    Just as I turned it on, I got clubbed in the back of the head with something.
    
    STEVE
    Ouch!

    ... And now I'm here.

    The building's been overrun with them.

    But who brought us here?
    Why did they keep us alive?
    
    LARRY
    I don't know.
    It doesn't seem like their way. Alien's have no reason to keep us alive.

    Unless they want to torture us.

    BARNEY_RADIO
    The aliens have technology far superior to ours.
    It's only a matter of time before the earth is taken over by them.
    They contacted us to make that happen faster...

    Barney?
    What did you do for them, Barney?
    
    BARNEY_RADIO
    We had our scientists and engineers join forces with theirs.
    Together, they designed and built a space portal.
    A gateway that links our worlds together.
    Spacheships are no longer required. Space travel is obsolete.
    Just step through the portal... and you're there.

    No... you're yanking my chain. That's impossible!

    I was just joking.

    You're right.

    Don't give me the "it's too dangerous" talk again.

    You choose.
    I'll come back for you once I find the red card, or another way out.
    ...
    Or follow me and help me search for the card.
    
    STEVE
    ...
    
    LARRY
    I understand if you want to go back. Don't feel bad about it.
    I have training. I signed up for this.
    You were just a visitor tonight.
    Just...don't let it be your pride that chooses for you.
    
    STEVE
    ...
    OK.
    Perhaps I take the safer route this time.
    
    LARRY
    Cool.
    I'll come back for you.
    
    STEVE
    Just... don't die.
    ...
    Here's something I found that you might be able to use...
    Look's like it's half of an access card.

    Thanks.

    Barney, you don't want to do this.

    You're right. I don't.

    Sir!

    Open the portal.

    They killed the Supreme Leader!
    Now they get a trial?!
    I won't give them the chance!

    Barrax!
    Don't be a fool! The trial is just for show.

    Larry, what was his name again?

    The Supreme Leader.

    Oh...

    Xenophobe? Like... as in a phobia of aliens?

    Yeah... it doesn't make sense, I know.

    It is *not* Xenophobe. That was the short name, but only phonetically.
    His full name is Sire Zeu Xenophobos!

    LARRY
    Hey, Barney.
    
    BARNEY
    Glad to see you're still alive.
    I had my doubts, but I knew you'd pull through.
    
    LARRY
    That doesn't make sense. You're contradicting yourself.
    
    BARNEY
    Meh... Learn to take a compliment.
    ...
    You got the yellow access card?
    Let me have it so I can make a copy.
    
    LARRY
    Wait a minute...
    
    BARNEY
    ...
    
    LARRY
    How do I know if you'll use this card for good...
    ... or for evil?
    
    BARNEY
    What are you talking about?
    
    LARRY
    You know...
    ... just in general.
    
    BARNEY
    ...
    *Sigh*
    Would you stop messin' around?
    Give me the card, Larry.
    
    LARRY
    Hmm... OK.
    
    BARNEY
    Now copying.

    Isn't that illegal?

    I suppose we're partners in crime now.

    Hey! Not me, pal.
    I'm not the one making a copy of a high-clearance security card.

    Why, of course...
    I'm always alive.

    At least this time it's for a good thing...
    like the code-yellow access card.
    Let me have it so I can make a copy.

    Why are you hesitating?

    Because I saved your life back at the elevator, remember?

    ...
    That...
    Um...
    That... is a very good reason, actually.

    Anyway...
    The yellow card will open more doors for you.
    But we're still trapped inside the building.
    Only the red access card can get us into the lobby...
    ... where we can make our escape.

    Right.

    Let's keep searching.
    Find the red card. Then radio me.

SCENE-DONUT-A
    
    MARKUS
    Take the doughnut, a simple, yet elegant design.
    An adequately-sized package that delivers calories and nutrients.
    Every part edible.
    Nothing remaining after you eat it. Nothing to throw away.
    
    LARRY
    Except maybe sticky fingers.
    
    MARKUS
    Right you are! I address that problem, however.
    I'll come back around to the sticky-fingers issue shortly.
    Now, back to the process...
    
    MARKUS
    I developed specialized eyewear...
    ...it allows me to see the world at a molecular resolution.
    It accentuates even the slightest impurities in anything I'm looking at.
    It is such fine detail, beyond the resolution of the eye.
    In fact, it can't use the eye. Our eyes are too low of a resolution.
    Instead, it bypasses the retina and optic nerve...
    ...and interfaces directly with the occipital lobe, the part of the brain that processes vision.
    
    LARRY
    And you use this for...?
    ...baking?
    
    MARKUS
    Precisely!
    
    MARKUS
    After frying, we use a proprietary method of refridgeration to cool the doughnut...
    ...to maintain its structural integrity.
    
    MARKUS
    I had a mechanic-friend help me design and develop a machine...
    ...that injects the precise amount of jelly into the now-cooled doughnut.
    It uses light beams and harmonic resonance to guide the jelly...
    ...across a short space and safely into the doughnut.
    
    MARKUS
    Then, finally, the doughnut is covered in a specialized resin.
    This resin diminishes the stickiness...
    ...but keeps the texture and taste of the glaze intact.
    ...so...
    No more sticky fingers!
