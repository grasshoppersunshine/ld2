		    After the conversation, head to the weapons locker to meet up with Barney and access
			the back room of the weapon's locker.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotx.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Larry and Barney chit-chat a little bit, then head to the back room. Barney mentions that they must find the red-access card now.<BR><BR>

			Since you have the yellow card, you don't need the blue one anymore, so you can drop that. Since there is a machine-gun there that takes the
			same ammo as the pistol and shoots alot faster, you can pick that up and drop the pistol. You no longer need the janitor's note either.
			The one thing you do need in that room are the batteries. You can pick those up, because you'll need them later. If you have a desert-eagle, the ammo
			in there would be useful since deagle ammo isn't very abundant.<BR><BR>

			Head to the basement.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz1.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Run all the way to the back and pick up the flashlight.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz2.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Mix the batteries with the flashlight. Then head to the 9th floor.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz3.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Go to the back of that room also. Once your all the way in the dark, use the flashlight.

			Clunk!!<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz5.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Larry wakes up and finds Steve with him.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz6.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Then Larry contacts Barney, and Barney reveals his evil plan and babbles on about some
			portal he and some other fellows built...yada yada yada.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz7.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			After that, Larry and Steve chat a bit. Steve mentions how there's no way out because he couldn't
			find one. Don't listen to him. The way out is some open vent you'll find if you head all the way
			to the right.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz8.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Once Larry and Steve crawl through the vent, Steve gives Larry a little something. It's on the floor
			next to Larry's feet after the conversation, so just pick it up and you'll find that it's half of a white card.
			The other half is on the 16th floor all the way in the back.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotz9.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Pick that up if you don't have it and mix it with the other half to get a full white card.
			There's only one door in the entire building that opens with a white card only, it's on floor 11.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotza.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Behind that door lay the red card.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotzb.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Once you pick up that red card, you could leave the building, but you can't yet because Larry won't leave
			without Steve. Make sure you grab some health and ammo, then head to the 21st floor.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotzc.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Oh no! Larry runs into a trap!<BR><BR>
