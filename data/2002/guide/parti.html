			When you start the game, you get a history of what happened getting you up-to-date on
			the story. Then you are taking to a scene where Larry and Steve just finished a game of chess.<BR><BR>			
			<IMG SRC="images/shot1.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>
			
			Unfortuanetly, Steve drinks some poisoned cola and collapses.<BR><BR> 
			<IMG SRC="images/shot2.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Finally, you get control Larry. Your objective as of now is to find help for steve.
			If you keep on running to the right, you'll run into a fellow janitor.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shot3.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Larry tells him that his buddy, Steve, needs help. Luckily, the janitor used to be a doctor, so he can help.
			They rush to steve.<BR><BR>

			<IMG SRC="images/shot4.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>
			Before the janitor could do anything, a rockmonster crashes through the window and chews him up.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shot5.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			You could punch the rockmonster to death, but there's no need. Run away to the right away from the rockmonster. Keep on
			going until you reach the elevator.<BR><BR>			
			<IMG SRC="images/shot6.gif" width="319" height="200"><BR><BR>

			From there, another rockmonster leaps into the air towards Larry. Before Larry gets chomped to death, Barney comes out of the
			elevator and blast the rockmonster into pieces.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shot7.gif" width="319" height="200"><BR><BR>

			After Larry is saved by Barney, they chit-chat a little bit and head to the weapons locker.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shot8.gif" width="319" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Barney gives you a blue-access card. Follow barney into the weapons locker. He'll give you a rap-up of what's
			been happening.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shot9.gif" width="319" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Once Barney's done talking, your free to go. Larry's objective now is to find a yellow-access card. Before you go, you'll
			want to grab some weapons and ammo. Press "P" to pick up items. There is a shotgun and a pistol in that room that Larry can get. There
			is also shotgun ammo and bullets. Press "TAB" to access your menu, or also known as the status screen.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shota.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Use the arrow keys to move up and down the menu. Press "ENTER" to select an item. When you select an item, a list of 4 actions
			will appear for you to choose what to do with that item.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotb.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			"USE" will let you use the item if allowed. The access cards are used automatically when you are next to a door.<BR>
			"LOOK" will show a description of the item.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotc.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			"MIX" will let you choose another item to mix your first item with.<BR>
			"DROP" will drop them item selected.<BR>
			If you look at an item, press "ENTER" to return back to the menu.<BR>
			As you can see, you only have 8 spaces to store items. So it is imperitive that you
			drop what you don't need so you have space for more important things you pick up along
			the way. You don't need your green card anymore since the blue card is everything the green
			card is plus more. You can drop it to make room for more space. To drop it, select the "GREEN CARD"
			and then select "DROP" by moving the arrow to it and pressing "ENTER".<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotd.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Once you drop it, you have an extra space to store another item.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shote.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Before you can use a weapon, you need to equip it. To equip it, select the weapon. Then select "USE", and
			the weapon will be equipped. However, you still can't use the weapon until you load it with ammo. To load the
			weapon with ammo, select the ammo for the weapon and select "USE". "SHOTGUN SHELLS" are for the shotgun and "BULLETS" are for
			the pistol. Now you can exit the menu and press "CTRL" or "Q" to shoot the weapon.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotf.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Grab some more ammo and your ready to go. It'd be a good idea to grab some first aid kits also.
			To leave the room, go infront of the elevator and press "TAB". A menu of the
			building will appear in which you can select which floor you want to go to.<BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/shotg.gif" width="320" height="200"><BR><BR>

			Phew! 22 floors for you to explore. Don't forget the rooftop and basement also. Really, only half of
			those floors are needed to complete the game.<BR><BR>
