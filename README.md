### Other Game Controllers
I have not tested with many controllers, but the layout should be similar to the Xbox 360 configuration.

## 2. Getting Started
You will be shown a launcher window at first. Change any options you'd like, or just click "Play Game" to begin.

### No EXE file? You can make it in a snap.
The files packaged in the game are made to quickly compile with the FreeBASIC Compiler from freebasic.net.
If you're on a Windows system, then that is the only program you need.
1. Go to the downloads page on freebasic.net.
2. Download the 32-bit build, version `1.06.0`. _No other versions have been tested._
3. Go into the `source` folder and run `fbc build.bas`, then run `build.exe` to compile the game.
4. When that finishes, copy `ld2.exe` to the parent folder and run that file to start the game.

## 3. Basic Gameplay / Flamethrower Mechanics

Use the arrow keys or the d-pad/analog-stick to move around. The primary action is **F** / **Space bar** for the keyboard and **A** for the Xbox 360 controller. The primary action will allow you to talk to NPCs, toggle switches, and fire your flamethrower.

Your main weapon will be the flamethrower. You can set things on fire, destroy trees, blow up barrels, and destroy enemies with it. Be cautious though, because the flamethrower can overheat.
### Overheating
There is a bar in the bottom-left corner of the screen. This is your **heat bar**. It tells you how hot your flamethrower is. The more you fire, the hotter it gets and the heat bar will continue to fill up. When you stop firing, the heat bar will drain, meaning that your flamethrower is cooling off. If the heat bar fills up completely, you'll lose the ability to fire for a few seconds, until the flamethrower cools down and the heat bar completely drains.

### Experience Points
Right above the heat bar is the **xp bar**. As you destroy enemies, you'll see sparkles that fly towards you. As you collect these, your xp bar will fill up. When it fills up completely, your flamethrower will automatically level-up to the next level and become more powerful. Level three is the highest level you can attain from the start. Later in the game, you can purchase upgrades that'll let you access higher levels. Once you reach the highest level, if your xp bar fills up again, you'll be rewarded with an extra life.

Dying will cause your xp bar to reset and your flamethower to revert to the first level.

## 4. Money / Loot

Toad On Fire uses food and gems for its currency. Gems are much more valuable than food. Move over the item to pick it up and it'll add to your total money/loot amount (shown in the bottom-right corner of the screen). You need to complete the level to keep the loot that you found.
You can play the same level again to collect more loot. However, you can only take the valuables once. That is to say that any loot you took last time is replaced by low-value potatoes and turnips.

#### Loot Value
```
Fruit.....................1
Corn......................1
Food Crate................5
Yellow Gem................5
Green Gem.................10
Potato....................1/2 (any food taken is replaced by these next time the level is played)
Turnip....................1   (any gems taken are replaced by these next time the level is played)
```

## 5. Upgrades
As you play the game, you'll acquire new upgrades and abilities. However, some upgrades and abilities must be purchased. So collect as much loot as you can so you can afford it when the time comes.
Upgrades are found in shops. Shops are levels that have the dollar-sign icon on the world map. You can talk to NPCs to purchase items. Other items can be found locked in chests that can only be opened if you have enough money. The amount will be displayed to you when you are close-up and facing the chest.
