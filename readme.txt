1. Story
------------------
	It's been a year since the alien invasion on earth.
	Last year, Larry and a team of five was set out to stop the alien invasion.
	After Larry's team of five was taken down one by one, Larry met Steve.
	Steve was camping out in the wilderness with his friend matt, who was eaten by
	a rockmonster. Larry continues on to save the earth. Eventually, Larry runs into
	Xenophobe, the master alien. After a tedious battle, Steve jumps in and zaps
	Xenophobe into oblivion with some big fat gun of his. The earth is saved.

	Now, a year later, Larry and Steve meet once again. After a game of chess, steve
	departs. After steve walks by a cola machine, he ask Larry for a quarter to get
	a cola. Larry just tells Steve to kick the machine and a cola will come out for
	free, so Steve kicks to machine and grabs a cola to quench his thirst. After
	drinking it he feels queezy and falls to the floor. Larry is left alone to go
	and find help. The story goes on from there.

------------------
2. Setting Up
------------------
	For best performance, make sure all programs are closed and that any dial-up
	connections to the internet are disconnected(especially if you are running 
	Windows ME) before running Larry The Dinosaur II.

	You will need to run SETUP.EXE first before running Larry The Dinosaur II. This is
	needed if you want to run the version with sound. If, however, you can't run that
	version or you just don't want sound, you can run NOSOUND.EXE to start the game
	without sound. Some people experience problems with the LD2.EXE because of the
	sound system it uses, especially people who use Windows XP. Running NOSOUND.EXE may
	solve the problem because it dosen't use the sound system.

	If your PC has a processor that operates less than 300mhz, the game may run slowly.
	You can speed it up by pressing L. L switches on/off the lighting effects which
	take alot of processing. The game dosen't look as cool with the lighting off, but
	if it works well with the lighting off, then you should keep it that way. You can
	also press V. This switches on/off the Vertical Retrace. Basically, it will
	switch on/off the speed control.
	If you are still experiencing problems with slowness, make sure all programs are
	closed, and if you have an open dial-up connection, disconnect it to improve speed.

4. How to play
------------------
	The game takes place in a 22 story building, including the roof and basement.
	You must do what you can to escape from the building.

	In-Game-
		During the game, Larry will be faced with aliens, puzzles, and other
		challenges. You will have to pick up items along the way. Press P to pick
		up an item. The item will be added to your inventory which you can access
		by press TAB. Read 'The Menu' section below on instructions on how to
		work your way around the inventory menu.	

	The Menu-
		
		To access the menu, press TAB. This will pull up the menu with your
		current inventory. If you wish to add something to your menu, you must
		first find what you want, move infront of it, and press P to pick it up.
		If you have no more space in your inventory, you will not pick it up.
		
		To select an item in your inventory, use the cursor keys to move the arrow
		to the item you want to select. Press ENTER to select it. Another menu
		will show up below the inventory with these selections:

			Use
			Look
			Mix
			Drop

		Use the cursor keys to move the arrow to select what you want to do with
		the object. Press ENTER to make the selection.

		Use-
			By selecting this, Larry will do something with the item if he can.
			You may have to be in the right place before using it, otherwise
			Larry will tell you that you can't use it or that your in the
			wrong place to use it.

		Look-
			By selecting this, a description of the item will show up.
			Press ENTER once you are done viewing the description.

		Mix-
			When you select this, you will have to choose another item in your
			inventory to mix the item with. If the two items cannot be mixed,
			Larry will tell you so. If the two items can be mixed, they will
			combine into 1 new item that will show up in your inventory.

		Drop-	By selecting this, Larry will drop the item selected clearing the
			inventory of that item.

	Weapons, Weapons, I want my bloody Weapons!

		There are 5 different weapons in the game.
		They are: Fist, Shotgun, Pistol, Machine-Gun, Desert Eagle

		You always have your fist incase you run out of ammo or just feel like
		punching some aliens to death. This weapon is very weak.

		You can press 2 for fist mode. Press 1 to go back to your weapon if you
		have a weapon equipped.

		To use a weapon, you must first have it equipped. To do this, you must
		pick up the weapon, select it in the inventory, and USE it. A message
		will appear saying that the weapon is equipped. You still need ammo for
		the gun also. You must pick up the right ammo for the gun(shotgun uses
		shells, pistol and machine-gun uses bullets, desert-eagle uses deagle
		bullets) Then select the ammo in the inventory and USE it. You need to have
		the weapon in the inventory when adding ammo to it. Once you have your
		weapon equipped and have ammo loaded into it, then you can use it.

	Using The Elevator-

		To use the elevator, walk infront of it and press TAB. From there, a menu
		will appear allowing you to choose which floor to go to. Use the arrow
		keys to move up and down the list. Press ENTER to select the floor that
		the arrow is pointing to. You will be taken there immediately.

5. Troubleshooting & FAQ
------------------------

	Some people experience problems when running LD2.EXE because of the sound system
	it uses, especially people who are running Windows XP. Running NOSOUND.EXE may
	solve this problem as it dosen't use the sound system which causes some of these
	problems.

	FAQ (Frequentlky Asked Questions)
	---------------------------------

	I tried to run LD2.EXE, but I just get a blank screen and nothing happens.
	
		- Try running NOSOUND.EXE

	The game starts up and says LOADING...PLEASE WAIT... but I wait forever and
	nothing happens.

		- Try running NOSOUND.EXE

	The game runs to slow.

		- Press L to disable the lighting. The lighting takes alot of processing
		  power, and with it gone, the game may run well. If this still dosen't
		  speed it up enough, you can try pressing V, which disables the vertical
		  retrace, basically the speed control.
